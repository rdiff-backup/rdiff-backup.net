<h2><a name="ToC5">Other related backup programs:</a></h2>
<p>Here are short descriptions of other mirroring/diffing backup
programs which may compete with rdiff-backup. Of course you should
consider me biased in favor of rdiff-backup, but I recognize that
rdiff-backup is not the best choice for every situation, and I try to
be fair in my comparisons.</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="http://rsync.samba.org">rsync</a></b> - the inspiration
for rdiff-backup. Although rsync and rdiff-backup do not share any
code, rdiff-backup uses the rsync algorithm, invented by rsync author
Andrew Tridgell.
<p>Compared to rdiff-backup, rsync is faster, so it is often the
better choice when pure mirroring is required. Also rdiff-backup does
not have a separate server like rsyncd (instead it relies on ssh-based
networking and authentication).</p>
<p>However, rdiff-backup uses much less memory than rsync on large
directories. Second, by itself rsync only mirrors and does not keep
incremental information (but see below). Third, rsync may not
preserve all the information you want to backup. For instance, if you
don't run rsync as root, you will lose all ownership information.
Fourth, rdiff-backup has a number of extra features, like extended
attribute and ACL suport, detailed file statistics, and SHA1
checksums.</p> </li>
<li><a name="rsync-scripts"><b>rsync-based scripts</b></a> - Because
rsync does not save incremental information, it is usually
inappropriate for backing up. There are several utilities which use
the rsync binary, but keep old data by using rsync --link-dest option
and rotating the destination directory.
<p>Compared to rdiff-backup, these are usually faster but use more
memory and disk space. They make each increment appear as a separate
complete directory, which is a neat feature. On the other hand, these
will usually be missing the features that are missing from rsync (see
above).</p>
<p>Here are various programs which use the rsync strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a
href="http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/">Mike
Rubel's rsync snapshots</a></b> - the original rsync hardlinking
script</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.rsnapshot.org/">rsnapshot</a></b> - based
off Mike Rubel's article</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.dirvish.com/">Dirvish</a></b> - perhaps the
most feature-filled of these programs</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.perusion.com/misc/Snapback2/">Snapback2</a></b></li>
</ul>
<p></p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/">BackupPC</a></b> - A
great, innovative program which notices when you save many copies of
the same file. Definitely take a look at this if you back up many
similar systems to the same destination (e.g. many windows PCs to a
central linux server).
<li><b><a
href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/index.html">Unison</a></b>
- a interesting bidirectional mirroring tool. Similar to rsync, but
changes propagate in either direction. Consider this if you need to
keep two directories synced and either may get edited.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://duplicity.nongnu.org/">duplicity</A></b> - Not
really like rdiff-backup because it doesn't mirror at all, but it's
here because it's written by the same author. It uses the rsync
algorithm but with a totally encrypted/untrusted destination.</li>
