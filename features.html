          <h3><a name="ToC2">rdiff-backup Features</a></h3>
          <p>For many people hard disks provide the form of persistent storage
          that is most readily available and cheapest per MB. I think that
          rdiff-backup is often the best way to back one hard drive to
          another.</p>

          <div class="feature-list">

            <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Easy to use:</strong> In most cases, the command
            <pre>
                 rdiff-backup dir1 dir2
            </pre>will work out-of-the-box to backup dir1 to dir2.
            <pre>
                 rdiff-backup dir1 user@system::/dir2
            </pre> will backup dir1 to dir2 on a different system (provided rdiff-backup is installed on both systems). rdiff-backup
            also comes with a lot of <a href="docs/docs.html">up-to-date documentation</a>.</p>
            <li><p><strong>Creates mirror:</strong> rdiff-backup makes the backup
            directory into an almost exact copy of the source directory (the only
            difference is one extra subdirectory on the backup side). If you
            delete a file from the source directory you can simply copy it from
            the backup directory, use "find" or "locate" to find the file, or use
            any other familiar utility. Also, if the two directories are on
            different disks, you can recover almost immediately if the disk
            containing the source directory crashes, just by mounting the backup
            directory where the source directory used to be.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Keeps increments:</strong> Normally, with a mirror, any
            changes made to the source directory are immediately sent to the
            backup directory, and old changes are lost. rdiff-backup saves those
            changes in the form of reverse diffs, so you can recover the older
            form of the file.</p>
            <P>For instance, suppose last week you deleted half of some document,
            thinking that what you had written was garbage. Yesterday, your
            backup event ran, saving these changes. Today you realize that you
            were on to something and want what you deleted back. If you just
            mirrored, you would be out of luck, since the copy on your mirror
            would be the newer one. With rdiff-backup, the newer version would
            indeed be present, but in a special directory (rdiff-backup-data/)
            there would be a file that recorded this change. Running rdiff-backup
            on this file recovers the version from a week ago.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Preserves all information:</strong> Whether you restore
            from the mirror directory or from an earlier incremental backup,
            rdiff-backup will reproduce your files exactly as they were. Files
            missing at the time of backup will also be missing after the restore.
            Files hard linked when backed up will be hard linked after the
            restore. rdiff-backup also preserves permissions, user and group
            ownership, modification time, device files, fifos, and symlinks.</p>
            <P>Sometimes it is impossible for the information to be replicated
            exactly on the destination. For instance, ownership cannot usually be
            replicated without root access at the destination; windows file
            systems may not be case sensitive and have no ownership at all.
            rdiff-backup records file metadata in a separate file so that all
            information is preserved even if the destination file system is
            missing features.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Space efficient:</strong> Suppose you have a large
            database file that changes a little bit every day. A normal
            incremental backup would keep saving copy after copy of this database,
            wasting a lot of space. rdiff-backup uses librsync, which implements
            the same efficient diffing algorithm that rsync uses. It works on
            binary files as well as text, so only a fraction of the data in your
            database would be saved in each incremental backup.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Bandwidth efficient:</strong> rdiff-backup depends on
            librsync, and thus uses the same diffing algorithm as rsync (rsync and
            rdiff-backup strictly speaking do not share any code however). As a
            result, when when writing to a remote location, rdiff-backup will only
            send diffs over and can use much less bandwidth than, say, ftp or
            scp.</p>
            <P>For instance, suppose you slightly alter large file A to make large
            file A', and A is still on the remote system. When rdiff-backup is
            run, it will only send over the diff A->A' (in order to "copy" A' to
            the remote system). Neither A nor A' needs to be sent in its
            entirety.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Transparent data format:</strong> Except for recording
            the hard link structure of old data sets, rdiff-backup doesn't
            absolutely require any data files formatted specifically for rdiff-backup.
            So if you want to stop using rdiff-backup in the future, you won't be
            stuck with any undecipherable files in some strange format. As noted
            above, the mirror directory will just be a copy of the source
            directory as it was when rdiff-backup was last run. Earlier states of
            your files are saved just by 1) keeping a copy of them, 2) in diff
            form as produced by rdiff, or 3) as a gzipped version of 1 or
            2.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Filesystem feature autodetection:</strong> People use
            rdiff-backup in many different environments. The filesystem they want
            to back up may be on Linux, Windows, or Mac. It may or may not be
            case sensitive, support characters like ":", have resource forks,
            extended attributes, or access control lists. Moreover, the file
            system they are backing up to may or may not support these features.</p>
            <p>rdiff-backup tries to handle these situations automatically without
            the need for switches like --acl --ea --no-ownership, etc. When run
            it will run tests on both the source and destination filesystems to
            see what features each supports like case sensitivity, changing
            uid/gid ownership, resource forks, extended attributes, or access
            control lists. To see the results of this testing, run rdiff-backup
            with verbosity 4 or higher, as in <code>-v4</code>.</p>
            <li><p><strong>Mac OS X resource fork support:</strong> On Mac OS X
            systems, rdiff-backup will backup the resource forks which store, for
            instance, Finder information. Most unix backup programs would only
            backup the data forks and discard the resource forks.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>ACL and EA support:</strong> If rdiff-backup can find
            the <a href="http://pylibacl.sourceforge.net/">pylibacl</a> and <a
            href="http://pyxattr.sourceforge.net/">pyxattr</a>
            (<a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/xattr">mac version</a>) modules, and if the file system supports these features, rdiff-backup will preserve Access
            Control Lists and user-level Extended Attributes. ACLs are not supported,
            however, on Mac OS X or Windows as those systems do not use standard
            POSIX.1e access controls.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Keeps statistics:</strong> After each session
            rdiff-backup writes summary statistics to a text file. You can
            inspect these to see how large your repository is, how fast it is
            growing, and how much space rdiff-backup is saving you, and more.
            Here is an example <code>session_statistics</code> file:<p>
            <p><pre>StartTime 1124018521.00 (Sun Aug 14 06:22:01 2005)
            EndTime 1124019454.64 (Sun Aug 14 06:37:34 2005)
            ElapsedTime 933.64 (15 minutes 33.64 seconds)
            SourceFiles 975715
            SourceFileSize 13078345389 (12.2 GB)
            MirrorFiles 975604
            MirrorFileSize 13076177922 (12.2 GB)
            NewFiles 119
            NewFileSize 1103075 (1.05 MB)
            DeletedFiles 8
            DeletedFileSize 190653 (186 KB)
            ChangedFiles 2032
            ChangedSourceSize 395324417 (377 MB)
            ChangedMirrorSize 394069372 (376 MB)
            IncrementFiles 2233
            IncrementFileSize 6098156 (5.82 MB)
            TotalDestinationSizeChange 8265623 (7.88 MB)
            Errors 80
            </pre></p>
            <p>rdiff-backup also saves very detailed statistics in a
            <code>file_statistics</code>. This file is also in (compressed) text
            form, but is usually too voluminous to read manually.</p> </li>
